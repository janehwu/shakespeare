 "summary": "The prologue of Romeo and Juliet calls the title characters “starcrossed
lovers”—and the stars do seem to conspire against these
young lovers.
Romeo is a Montague, and Juliet a Capulet. Their families are
enmeshed in a feud, but the moment they meet—when Romeo and his
friends attend a party at Juliet’s house in disguise—the two fall in love
and quickly decide that they want to be married.
A friar secretly marries them, hoping to end the feud. Romeo and his
companions almost immediately encounter Juliet’s cousin Tybalt, who
challenges Romeo. When Romeo refuses to fight, Romeo’s friend
Mercutio accepts the challenge and is killed. Romeo then kills Tybalt
and is banished. He spends that night with Juliet and then leaves for
Mantua.
Juliet’s father forces her into a marriage with Count Paris. To avoid
this marriage, Juliet takes a potion, given her by the friar, that makes
her appear dead. The friar will send Romeo word to be at her family
tomb when she awakes. The plan goes awry, and Romeo learns
instead that she is dead. In the tomb, Romeo kills himself. Juliet
wakes, sees his body, and commits suicide. Their deaths appear finally
to end the feud."}
