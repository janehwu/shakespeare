 "summary": "The Two Noble Kinsmen, derived from Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales,
begins as Athens defeats Thebes in war. Arcite and Palamon, Theban
knights and devoted cousins, are imprisoned in Athens. From their
cell, they see Emilia, the sister-in-law of Theseus, Duke of Athens.
Both fall in love with her, becoming bitter rivals.
Arcite is released but, for love of Emilia, stays in Athens at the risk of
his life. The jailer’s daughter, who loves Palamon, helps him escape,
but goes mad with anxiety. Her original wooer cures her by courting
her while pretending to be Palamon.
Arcite encounters Palamon and challenges him to formal combat for
Emilia. Theseus discovers them before they duel. He first sentences
both to death, but then establishes a contest in which each will
participate with Theban comrades. The loser and his knights will die.
The winner will wed Emilia.
Arcite prays to Mars for victory; Palamon, to Venus for Emilia’s love.
Both prayers are answered. Arcite wins, but dies after a riding
accident. Palamon, spared from execution, marries Emilia."}
