 "summary": "The nautical tale of a wandering prince, Pericles is narrated by John
Gower, a poet from the English past. Gower explains that Pericles,
Prince of Tyre, hopes to win the hand of a princess in Antioch. When
Pericles learns that she and the king, her father, are lovers, he flees for
his life.
Pericles brings grain to Tarsus during a famine, but loses his ships and
men in a storm. In Pentapolis, Pericles wins a tournament and marries
the king’s daughter, Thaisa. With Thaisa pregnant, she and Pericles
sail for Tyre. Thaisa bears a daughter, Marina, at sea, but apparently
dies. Her coffin drifts ashore at Ephesus, where she is revived and
becomes a priestess of Diana.
Pericles leaves the baby Marina with the king and queen of Tarsus.
Fourteen years later, Marina, kidnapped by pirates, is sold to a
brothel, but her eloquence protects her. Told that she has died, a griefstricken
Pericles rediscovers her. Guided by a vision from the goddess
Diana, Pericles and Marina reunite with Thaisa."}
