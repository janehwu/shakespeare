 "summary": "Titus Andronicus overflows with death and violence. Twenty-one sons
of the Roman general Titus Andronicus have died in battle, leaving
four alive. After defeating the Goths, Titus permits the sacrifice of the
oldest son of their queen, Tamora.
Titus helps Saturninus become emperor. Saturninus plans to marry
Titus’s daughter, Lavinia. Instead, she marries Bassianus, aided by
Titus’s sons, one of whom Titus kills. Saturninus then marries
Tamora. The stage is set for multiple revenge plots.
Tamora’s lover, Aaron the Moor, instructs her two sons to kill
Bassianus, then falsely implicates two of Titus’s sons. Tamora’s sons
also rape Lavinia, cutting off her tongue and hands. To save his sons
from execution, Titus cuts off his own hand, but Aaron sends him
their heads.
Lucius, Titus’s last son, leads an army of Goths against Rome. Titus
kills Tamora’s sons and serves them to her in a pie. In the ensuing
events, Lavinia, Tamora, Titus, and Saturninus all die. Lucius
becomes emperor and sentences Aaron to death."}
