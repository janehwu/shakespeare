 "summary": "The events in King John take place in the thirteenth century, well
before Shakespeare’s other English history plays. After the death of
John’s brother, Richard I, John rules England.
John’s young nephew, Arthur, has a claim to the throne and is
supported by the French. At first, a proposed marriage between the
French crown prince and John’s niece, Blanche, calms Anglo-French
tensions. Then the pope, in a dispute over recognizing an archbishop,
excommunicates John and backs Arthur’s claim.
After war erupts, John captures Arthur and orders his death. Arthur’s
guardian, Hubert, prepares to burn out Arthur’s eyes, but then spares
him. Arthur dies leaping from the prison wall. Arthur’s mother
Constance grieves inconsolably.
Meanwhile, French forces reach England. John submits to the pope to
gain his aid. Rebellious English nobles join the French, but return to
John when they learn the French prince plans to kill them. English
forces under the bastard son of Richard I expel the French, but a monk
poisons King John, whose son becomes Henry III."}
