 "summary": "In Love’s Labor’s Lost, the comedy centers on four young men who
fall in love against their wills. The men, one of them the king of
Navarre, pledge to study for three years, avoiding all contact with
women. When the Princess of France arrives on a state visit, the king
insists she and her ladies camp outside the court. Even so, each young
man falls in love with one of the ladies.
Meanwhile, Don Armado, a Spanish soldier, falls for a servant girl,
Jacquenetta. Costard, an illiterate local, mixes up two letters he is to
deliver, one from Armado to Jacquenetta and the other from Berowne,
one of the king’s companions, to Rosaline, one of the French ladies.
The men confess they are in love, and devise a pageant for the ladies,
who set a trap for them by exchanging identifying markers. When
word comes that the princess’s father is dead, the ladies reject the
men’s proposals as rash and impose a year’s delay before any further
wooing."}
