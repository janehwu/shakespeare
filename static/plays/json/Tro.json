 "summary": "Set during the Trojan War, Troilus and Cressida recounts the love
affair of its title characters. Inside the besieged city of Troy, the Trojan
prince Troilus is lovesick for Cressida. Cressida is drawn to Troilus,
too, and her uncle, Pandarus, brings them together.
In the Greek camp outside, Cressida’s father, Calchas, asks that
Cressida be brought to him in return for the help he has given the
Greeks. The morning after the lovers’ night together, Cressida is
exchanged for a Trojan prisoner and taken to the camp by the Greek
warrior Diomedes.
The great Trojan warrior Hector, Troilus’s brother, engages in single
combat with the Greek Ajax, a fight that ends inconclusively. Hector
and Troilus join the Greeks for a feast. Cressida, meanwhile, is
seduced by Diomedes.
Distraught at Cressida’s betrayal, Troilus fights Diomedes and others.
Patroclus, favorite of the Greek warrior Achilles, dies in battle.
Achilles fights with and loses to Hector, who is then, on Achilles’s
orders, dishonorably slain. Grieving, Troilus and the other Trojans
return to Troy."}
