 "summary": "King Lear dramatizes the story of an aged king of ancient Britain,
whose plan to divide his kingdom among his three daughters ends
tragically. When he tests each by asking how much she loves him, the
older daughters, Goneril and Regan, flatter him. The youngest,
Cordelia, does not, and Lear disowns and banishes her. She marries
the king of France. Goneril and Regan turn on Lear, leaving him to
wander madly in a furious storm.
Meanwhile, the Earl of Gloucester’s illegitimate son Edmund turns
Gloucester against his legitimate son, Edgar. Gloucester, appalled at
the daughters’ treatment of Lear, gets news that a French army is
coming to help Lear. Edmund betrays Gloucester to Regan and her
husband, Cornwall, who puts out Gloucester’s eyes and makes
Edmund the Earl of Gloucester.
Cordelia and the French army save Lear, but the army is defeated.
Edmund imprisons Cordelia and Lear. Edgar then mortally wounds
Edmund in a trial by combat. Dying, Edmund confesses that he has
ordered the deaths of Cordelia and Lear. Before they can be rescued,
Lear brings in Cordelia’s body and then he himself dies."}
