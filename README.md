# Visualizing Shakespeare

Description:
Shakespeare’s works have been performed and analyzed for centuries, yet truly understanding the text often requires extensive manual data collection - from character relationships to prevalent themes to inter-play connections. Our project allows users to easily visualize the structural properties of Shakespeare’s plays, such that anyone from an actor to a director can enrich their interpretations of the text. Automated data collection provides us with more data to make the visualizations more detailed and accurate.
